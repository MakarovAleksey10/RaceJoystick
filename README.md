# RaceJoystick
  These are two programs in Java: a server and a client. The server is written for Android and is a source of information about the position of the smartphone in space. The client receives this information and controls the pressing of the car's "Right", "Left", "Accelerator" and "Brake" keys.
The client runs on the PC. The programs communicate over a wi-fi network. 
For correct operation, you need to configure the game on your PC (for example, rally or racing) to be controlled by the arrow keys.
